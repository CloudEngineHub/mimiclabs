Welcome to MimicLabs, your one-stop place for collecting and generating datasets for table-top manipulation! MimicLabs provides a framework for describing a suite of MuJoCo-based tasks, collecting expert demonstrations, and large-scale data generation using MimicGen.

This is also the official repository for the study paper ''What Matters in Learning from Large-Scale Datasets for Robot Manipulation'' appearing at [ICLR 2025](https://iclr.cc/).

In this repo, we leverage various open-source projects, including Robosuite, LIBERO, RoboCasa, and MimicGen. We thank their authors for making their code publicly available.

## Getting started with MimicLabs

MimicLabs allows you to create a suite of tasks, collect demonstrations, and expand your datasets using MimicGen. Our workflow consists of the following 3 stages:

1. Set up your task configs (BDDLs) (use `mimiclabs/mimiclabs`)

2. Collect source demonstrations (use `mimiclabs/data_collection`)

3. Expand your datasets (using MimicGen) (use `mimiclabs/mimicgen`)

We provide detailed documentation for each of these stages under `docs/modules`, including an example workflow in `docs/examples`. For more details, see the [documentation](https://robo-mimiclabs.github.io/docs/getting_started/welcome.html).

For the MimicLabs study, we constructed a vast suite of task configs that you can find in this repo under `mimiclabs/mimiclabs/task_suites/mimiclabs_study`. We also make our simulation datasets available on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/vaibhavsaxena11/mimiclabs_datasets/tree/main).

## Installation
